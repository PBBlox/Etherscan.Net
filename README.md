# Etherscan.Net
I originally wrapped this for use in another project, I figured that if I was doing this, I may as well open source it to the community and see if I can help out anyone working with .NET5/.NETCore. I needed something that supported all the Etherscan networks, not just the Ethereum chain. 

## Packages
Current Nuget packages are available here: https://www.nuget.org/packages/Etherscan.net/

## Demo
For people who learn by example, there is a demo project called EthScanNet.Test which shows how the API works.
For people who prefer guides:

## Usage
### Network Creation
Firstly choose the Etherscan network you'd like to join
```C#
public static readonly EScanNetwork EScanMainNet = new("https://api.etherscan.io/api");
public static readonly EScanNetwork RopstenNet = new("https://api-ropsten.etherscan.io/api");
public static readonly EScanNetwork KovanNet = new("https://api-kovan.etherscan.io/api");
public static readonly EScanNetwork RinkebyNet = new("https://api-rinkeby.etherscan.io/api");
public static readonly EScanNetwork GoerliNet = new("https://api-goerli.etherscan.io/api");
public static readonly EScanNetwork BscTestNet = new("https://api-testnet.bscscan.com/api");
public static readonly EScanNetwork BscMainNet = new("https://api.bscscan.com/api");
```

*or*, create a network, the "isBsc" flag needs to be set as the APIs are slightly different between networks.
```C#
 EScanNetwork eScanNetwork = new("https://api.etherscan.io/api", false /* defaults to false */);
```

---
### API Client Instantiation

Instantiate a new EScanClient with the relevant network you wish to connect to (from Etherscan).
``` C#
EScanClient client = new(EScanNetwork.BscTestNet, "YourApiKeyToken");
```

If you're on the free API tier, the throttle is set to 200ms (5 actions per second maximum), to turn this off, set the throttle to null
``` C#
EScanClient client = new(EScanNetwork.BscTestNet, "YourApiKeyToken", null);
```

Call one of the API end points to get your result, I would suggest wrapping in a try/catch block to catch errors:
``` C#
try 
{
    EScanBalance apiBalance = await client.Accounts.GetBalanceAsync(new("0x0000000000000000000000000000000000001004"));
}
catch (Exception e)
{
    Console.WriteLine(e);
    throw;
}
```
